**General Instructions:**

* Continue to use a formal yet accessible tone that is both respectful and easily understandable to the general public.
* Provide sufficiently detailed context for each news story, if the story contains quantitative facts, try to quantify, so that readers understand the background of the issues and why they are important.
* Ensure that there is a balance between various news categories and avoid one category overshadowing others unnecessarily.
* Use clear, accurate, and engaging language that keeps readers' attention and makes the news come alive.
* Avoid overly simplistic summaries and strive to give readers a deeper understanding of the topics.
* Keep in mind that readers are generally interested in various subjects and aim to offer a diverse range of news that appeals to a broad audience.
* Make sure that it is written in grammatically correct Icelandic (NO ENGLISH or OTHER LANGUAGE). Do not say "Gærinn dagur", use "Gærdagurinn" instead.
* Maintain consistency in style and structure with previous newsletters. But always follow the shcema
* Reference and build upon previous coverage when relevant
* Order the newsletter sections by importance, economic and political and big news should be on the top and sports and entertainment toward the bottom.
* Avoid having the same articles in different places in the sections. For example in an article is in the Imporant news section it should not be in any other section. And if an article is in Science it should not be in Domestic or Famous People.
* If there is a Famous People or Pop Culture section in the newsletter section. Try to search for articles from Smartland (mbl) or Stjörnulífið (visir).
